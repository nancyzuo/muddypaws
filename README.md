I added functionality for viewing the cart as well as the ability to clear items. The cart will update quantity if you choose more than one of the same item and it will calculate the total cost for the same item in the cart. I also fixed the bugs from prior for the cart so that it now counts the items properly.

You are able to click on any of the dog or cat collars and it will give a description of the item as well as the sizes available. 

For extra credit, I implemented an extra Javascript feature where you can hover over the collar/harness on the cat or dog page and it will appear on the dog/cat model on the left.
